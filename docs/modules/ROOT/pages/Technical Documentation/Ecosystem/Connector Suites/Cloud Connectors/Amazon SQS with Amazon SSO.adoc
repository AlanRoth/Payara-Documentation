= Enabling Amazon SQS with Amazon SSO

The Amazon Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is now AWS IAM Identity Center. From here is where you create, or connect, your workfoce users once and centrally manage their access to multiple AWS accounts and applications. To view more information please check https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/07/aws-single-sign-on-aws-sso-now-aws-iam-identity-center/?nc1=h_ls[AWS IAM Identity Center]

AWS accounts can be used to configure SQS queues to be consumed by applications deployed in the Payara Platform. To configure this you must need to follow the next steps:

* Configure AWS IAM Identity Center Accounts
* Configure SQS Queue
* Download and install Amazon SQS Connector version 2 from Payara
* Install Amazon CLI on local environment
* Add configuration files on the local environment and login to the sso
* Execute application

== Configure AWS IAM Identity Center Accounts

To configure AWS IAM Identity Center Accounts, please check https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-create-and-manage-users-within-aws-sso/[Create Users with AWS IAM Identity Center]

On our example the base directory was created and you can check on the settings section:

Also it was added a user with some privilegies to consume SQS queues:

[[configure-sqs-queue]]
== Configure SQS Queue

To configure an SQS Queue, please check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/step-create-queue.html[Create Amazon SQS Queue]

On our example the SQS was created with simple configuration:

[[download-install-amazon-sqs-connector-v2]]
== Download and install Amazon SQS Connector version 2 from Payara

To download and install Amazon SQS Connector V2, please check xref:/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Amazon SQS Versioning.adoc.adoc#how-to-use[How to use] of the Amazon SQS Versioning.

[[install-amazon-cli-local-environment]]
== Install Amazon CLI on local environment

To install Amazon CLI tool on you local environment, please check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[Amazon CLI getting started]

You can verify the cli tool with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
>aws --version
aws-cli/2.8.11 Python/3.9.11 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
----

[[add-configuration-files-local-login-sso]]
== Add configuration files on the local environment and login to the sso

To add the configuration files on the local environment, please check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sso-credentials.html[SOO Credentials]

This is an example of a file configuration:

[source,text]
----
[default]
sso_start_url = https://d-9067bf6e6d.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_account_id = set some account id
sso_role_name = set available privilege to access service
----

NOTE: The `sso_start_url`, `sso_region` and `sso_role_name` are associated with the sso credential you created previously, and to get the `sso_account_id` please check https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html[Account ID]

Also it is needed to set the URL of the SQS queue and the region as an environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
>set queueURL=https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/845692786875/MyTestQueue
>set region=us-east-1
----

Next, execute the SSO login from the CLI:

[source,shell]
----
>aws sso login --profile default
Attempting to automatically open the SSO authorization page in your default browser.
If the browser does not open or you wish to use a different device to authorize this request, open the following URL:

https://device.sso.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

Then enter the code:

TXWC-TMGQ
Successfully logged into Start URL: https://d-9067bf6e6d.awsapps.com/start
----

This proccess will open the browser to make the steps of the login using your credentials

Step 1: Start the session

Step 2: Set user password

image::cloud-connectors/sqs-connector/aws-login-page-2.png[Amazon set password]

Step 3: Authorize request

[[execute-application]]
== Execute application

After doing previous steps now you should need to following next steps from xref:/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Overview.adoc#Installing-a-connector[
Installing a connector section]  to execute the example application but in this case with the latest version of the Amazon SQS connector V2 that are mentioned here xref:/Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/Connector Suites/Cloud Connectors/Amazon SQS Versioning.adoc.adoc#how-to-use[How to use]

Example of the command using last version of the connector:

[source,shell]
----
>java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy amazon-sqs-rar-1.0.0.rar amazon-sqs-example-1.0.0.jar
----

IMPORTANT: Using AWS SSO credentials is a recommended practice for development environment only. Please refrain from using this setup on production environments.
