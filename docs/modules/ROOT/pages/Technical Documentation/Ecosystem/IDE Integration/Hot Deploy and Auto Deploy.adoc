= Hot Deploy and Auto Deploy

IMPORTANT: To enable these features, the relevant ecosystem plugin to your IDE of choice must be installed.

All four of the IDE Integrations supported by Payara allow for the use of Hot Deploy and Auto Deploy. After enabling either the Hot Deploy or Auto Deploy feature on your IDE of choice, simply deploy web applications to Payara Server and modify any Java class of the application, upon save, any changed files within the application will be redeployed.

Payara Server provides the Hot Deployment capability, which boosts the performance of the application redeployment operation and dynamically replaces the classloader of the application on each redeployment in the hot deploy mode. Hot deploy is significantly faster than a vanilla redeployment, boosting developer productivity.

Alternatively, Payara Server also allows for a full redeployment of the application automatically via the Auto Deploy feature. It will un-deploy the existing application and redeploy the new application on every save action. As the Auto Deploy feature performs a full redeploy of an application, it is slower than hot redeploy, which redeploys only the changed part of an application.
