= Payara Apache NetBeans Tools

Apache NetBeans IDE 11.1 and higher provides out-of-the-box support for Payara Platform
to integrate Payara Server and Payara Micro into the Apache NetBeans IDE. Therefore there is no need to manually install the Payara Tools plugin for the NetBeans IDE.

IMPORTANT: Currently there is no support for Payara 6 within the NetBeans IDE.
