= Migrate Maven Projects or Files From JavaEE to Jakarta EE 10

A new option for the Payara VS Code extension was added to enable the migration of applications from JavaEE to Jakarta EE 10. To see how to install please check xref:Technical Documentation/Ecosystem/IDE Integration/VSCode Extension/Overview.adoc[Overview]

== Migrate File to Jakarta 10

To make the migration of a single file you should select the file right-click on it and select Migrate to Jakarta EE 10

Finally you can check the output of the migration process using the output tab

To verify the resulting file you must need to open with the VSCode of with a different editor

== Migrate File to Jakarta 10 on the same folder

You can make the migration of a file on the same folder. In this case you should need to accept the override of the file because the original file should be removed. To make this you should select the file right-click on it and select Migrate to Jakarta EE 10.

then you need to select the destination folder to make the migration, in this case please select the same folder

You will see an information message to confirm if you will override the file on the same folder

If you accept the override operation you will see on the VSCode the same file after the migration process

NOTE: If you select options No, Cancel or press ESC then the migration process will stop

== Migrate Directory to Jakarta 10

You can make the migration of a folder with source files to Jakarta EE 10. This operation will affect all the resources from the directory and you can see the result after finishing the process on a new window from the VSCode. To make this you need to select base folder to migrate right-click on it and select Migrate to Jakarta EE 10

then you need to write the name of the new destination folder to make the folder migration

NOTE: You should need to select different folder to prevent any issue. The transform operation will do a lot of internal mechanisms to change and replace old fragments of code not compatible with jakarta 10. We recommend to select a different folder to prevent collision on the same source files.

Then you can see the result of the process from the output tab and also you will see and information message to confirm the resulting operation

NOTE: After migrating a folder you should need to apply by hand the pom configuration files. This is a restriction for the transform maven plugin.

Finally you can open the new folder from the VSCode
