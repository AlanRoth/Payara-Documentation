= Using Admin Console

Concurrent resources can be created by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands. 

To configure the resources in the Admin Console, go to Resources → Concurrent Resources:

The four types of concurrent resources can be created via Admin Console.

== New Context Service

To create a new Context Service in the Admin Console, go to Resources → Concurrent Resources → Context Services → New:

image:concurrency/new_context_service.png[New Context Service]

Or it can be created using asadmin command:

=== `create-context-service`

*Usage*::
----
asadmin> create-context-service [--help]
        [--enabled={false|true}]
        [--contextinfoenabled={false|true}]
        [--contextinfo={Classloader|JNDI|Security|WorkArea}]]
        [--description description]
        [--property property]
        [--target target]
        jndi_name
----
*Aim*::
The `create-context-service` subcommand creates a context service resource. +
This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

|Specifies whether the resource should be used for long-running tasks. If set to true, long-running tasks are not reported as stuck.
|false
|No

|`useforkjoinpool`
|Boolean
|If enabled, a ForkJoinPool will be used instead of the default thread pool. This pool uses the Fork/Join framework, where all threads in the pool attempt to find and execute tasks, with free threads attempting to "steal" work from deques of busy threads.

|Integer
|Specifies the number of seconds that a task can execute before it is considered unresponsive.
|0
|No

|`corepoolsize`
|Integer
|Specifies the number of threads to keep in a thread pool, even if they are idle. When a new task is submitted and the number of running threads is less than `corepoolsize`, a new thread is created to handle the request. When the value for `corepoolsize` is 0 (the default), new threads are never created unless the task queue is full or the resource is using direct queuing. Direct queuing occurs when `taskqueuecapacity` is 0, or when `taskqueuecapacity` is 2147483647 and `corepoolsize` is 0.
|0
|No

|`maximumpoolsize`
|Integer

|60
|No

|`threadlifetimeseconds`
|Integer
|Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain in a thread pool before being purged, regardless of whether the number of threads is greater than `corepoolsize` or whether the threads are idle.
|0
|No

|`taskqueuecapacity`
|Integer
|Specifies the number of submitted tasks that can be stored in the task queue awaiting execution.
|2147483647
|No

|`description`
|String
|Descriptive details about the resource.
|-
|No

|`property`
|String
|Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource. {product---name} does not define any additional properties for this resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any additional properties
