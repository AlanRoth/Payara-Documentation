= Configuring Context Services

Context services are used to create dynamic proxy objects that capture the context of a container and enable applications to run within that context at a later time. The context of the container is propagated to the thread executing the task.

The following tasks are used to administer context service resources:

* To Create a Context Service
* To List Context Services
* To Update a Context Service
* To Delete a Context Service

NOTE: The Jakarta EE specifies that certain default resources be made available to applications, and defines specific JNDI names for these default resources. Payara Server makes these names available through the use of logical JNDI names, which map Jakarta EE JNDI names to specific Payara Server resources. +
For context services, the mapping is as follow: +
`java:comp/DefaultContextService` +
This Jakarta Concurrency standard name is mapped to the `concurrent/__defaultContextService` resource.

[[to-create-context-service]]
== To Create a Context Service

Context services can be created by using Admin Console or Asadmin commands.

To create a new Context Service in the Admin Console, go to Resources → Concurrent Resources → Context Services → New:

image:concurrency/new_context_service.png[New Context Service]

Or use the `create-context-service` subcommand in remote mode to create a context service resource.

Because all JNDI names are in the `java:comp/env` subcontext, when specifying the JNDI name of a context service, use only the `concurrent/name` format. For example, `concurrent/Context1`. 

IMPORTANT: Creating a context service resource is a dynamic event and typically does not require server restart. Applications can use a resource as soon as it is created. However, if an application tried to use a resource before it was created, and that resource is created later, the application or the server must be restarted. Otherwise, the application will not be able to locate the resource.

. Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Create a context service by using the `create-context-service` subcommand. 
. If necessary, notify users that the new resource has been created.

=== Usage
----
asadmin> create-context-service [--help]
        [--enabled={false|true}]
        [--contextinfoenabled={false|true}]
        [--contextinfo={Classloader|JNDI|Security|WorkArea}]]
        [--description description]
        [--property property]
        [--target target]
        jndi_name
----
*Aim*::
The `create-context-service` subcommand creates a context service resource. +
This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

=== Command Options

[cols=",,,,", options="header"]
|===
|Option
|Type
|Description
|Default
|Mandatory

|`enabled`
|Boolean
|Determines whether the resource is enabled at runtime.
|true
|No

|`contextinfoenabled`
|Boolean
|Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If set to `true`, the contexts specified in the `--contextinfo` option are propagated. If set to `false`, no contexts are propagated and the `--contextinfo` option is ignored.
|true
|No

|`contextinfo`
|String
|Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads. Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
|`Classloader,JNDI,Security,WorkArea`
|No

|`description`
|String
|Descriptive details about the resource.
|-
|No

|`property`
|String
|Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource. {product---name} does not define any additional properties for this resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any additional properties
|-
|No

|`target`
|String
|Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid targets are: server, domain, cluster_name, instance_name
|server
|No
|===

=== Command Operands
*jndi_name*::
The JNDI name of this resource.

=== Example

[source, shell, subs="quotes"]
----
asadmin> *create-context-service* --description "context example" --property name=Jose --target domain concurrent/myContextService
Context service concurrent/myContextService created successfully.
Command create-context-service executed successfully.
----

[[to-list-context-services]]
== To List Context Services

Use the `list-context-services` subcommand in remote mode to list the existing
context service resources.

. Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List context service resources by using the `list-context-services` subcommand.

=== Listing Context Service
This example lists context service resources on the default server instance, server.
[source, shell, subs="quotes"]
----
asadmin> *list-context-services*
concurrent/__defaultContextService
concurrent/Context1
concurrent/Context2 
Command list-context-services executed successfully.
----

You can also view the full syntax and options of the subcommand by typing `asadmin help list-context-service` at the command line.

[[to-update-context-services]]
== To Update a Context Service

You can change all of the settings for an existing context service resource except its
JNDI name. Use the `get` and `set` subcommands to view and change the values of the context service attributes.

IMPORTANT: When a resource is updated, the existing resource is shut down and recreated. If an application used the resource prior to the update, the application or the server must be restarted.

. Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List the context service resources by using the `list-context-services`
subcommand.
. View the attributes of a specific context service by using the `get` subcommand. +
For example: +
`asadmin> *get resources.context-service.concurrent/Context1.**`
. Set an attribute of the context service by using the set subcommand. +
For example: +
`asadmin> *set resources.context-service.concurrent/Context1.deployment-order=120*`

[[to-delete-context-services]]
== To Delete a Context Service

Use the `delete-context-service` subcommand in remote mode to delete an existing context service. Deleting a context service is a dynamic event and does not require server restart.

Before deleting a context service resource, all associations to the resource must be removed.

. Ensure that the server is running. +
Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List the context service resources by using the `list-context-services`
subcommand.
. If necessary, notify users that the context service is being deleted.
. Delete the context service by using the `delete-context-service` subcommand.

=== Deleting a Context Service
This example deletes the context service resource named `concurrent/Context1`.

[source, shell, subs="quotes"]
----
asadmin> *delete-context-service concurrent/Context1*
Context service concurrent/Context1 deleted successfully.
Command delete-context-service executed successfully.
