= About Concurrent Resources

Concurrent resources are managed objects that provide concurrency capabilities to Java EE applications. In Payara Server, you configure concurrent resources and make them available for use by application components such as servlets and EJBs. Concurrent resources are accessed through JNDI lookup or resource injection.

Concurrent resources are resources of the following types: 

* Context services. See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Concurrency Enhancements/Configuring Context Services.adoc[Configuring Context Services].
* Managed thread factories. See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Concurrency Enhancements/Configuring Managed Thread Factories.adoc[Configuring Managed Thread Factories]. 
* Managed executor services. See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Concurrency Enhancements/Configuring Managed Executor Services.adoc[Configuring Managed Executor Services]. 
* Managed scheduled executor services. See xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Server Configuration And Management/Concurrency Enhancements/Configuring Managed Scheduled Executor Services.adoc[Configuring Managed Scheduled Executor Services].
