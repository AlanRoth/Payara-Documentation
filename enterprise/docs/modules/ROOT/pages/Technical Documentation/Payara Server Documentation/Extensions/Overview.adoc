= Server Extensions

Payara Server Enterprise Edition allows plugin extensions to expand the features of the server's runtime. These extensions are not included in the default server's runtime and they must be installed before considering their usage.

Currently, the following extensions are provided:

xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Extensions/gRPC Support/Overview.adoc[gRPC Support]::
The gRPC Support module allows web applications to define gRPC services which can be consumed by client applications.

xref:/Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Extensions/Codehaus Cargo/Overview.adoc[Codehaus Cargo]::
The Codehaus Cargo plugin allows you to manipulate various types of application containers (including Payara Server) in order to deploy, undeploy, start, stop, and redeploy applications.
