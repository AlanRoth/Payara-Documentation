= Notifier Extensions

The notifier extensions allow notifications from the Notification Service to propagate to various channels on top of the notifiers provided by default.

IMPORTANT: Currently there is no compatible version of the Payara Notifiers with Payara Server {page-version}. A compatible version will be made available soon, if you require Payara Notifiers in the meantime, consider a Payara Enterprise subscription to continue recieving support for Payara Server 5 where the notifiers extension is available.
